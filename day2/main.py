Puzzle #1
Objective: find the product of the submarine's final horizontal position and depth
after it follows the planned course in the input file with 
`forward` (changing horizontal position) and `up`/`down` (changing depth)

`up` decreases depth
`down` increases depth

Lessons learned: Create a .txt with test input (instead of a list) in order to test the 
read functionality

SOLUTION (~15 minutes)

read input file and split each line into a tuple (direction, units)
loop through the list of tuples
if the direction is forward, add the units to the horizontal position
if the direction is up, subtract the units from depth
if the direction is down, add the units to depth
return the product of horizontal position and depth

Puzzle 2

this introduces an `aim` command in the course 
`aim` is multiplied by forward to determine the change in depth
